            <h1>Where do I begin?</h1>
            <p>One of the first things I'd recommend would be the book that got me in art in the first place! <br> It's called drawing on the right side of the brain, by Betty Edwards <br> This book is incredible for learning the initial art skills you'll need on your journey!<br> after fully finishing it and following the exercises, you can definitely draw things like self-portraits, or even scenery you see on your day to day life</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <p>Another book I'd highly recommend is Fun With a Pencil by Andrew Loomis <br> It started the now known Loomis method of drawing, and it's pretty much THE book to go for <br> if your main objective is drawing things that aren't based in reality, such as cartoons, for example<br> If you want to draw anime, you might think this isn't for you, but the Loomis method can prove mega useful even outside of the context of cartoons. It's extremely useful</p>
